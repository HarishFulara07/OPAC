# Online Public Access Catalog

Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) built using JavaFX.

An Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) is a library portal which is part of Library Management System (LMS). I have designed an OPAC system where Customers/Visitors of the library can search library catalog to locate various resources - books, periodicals, audio, visual materials and ebook readers. Each copy of a resource has a unique ID. Customers may reserve or release item and manage their account/profile.
